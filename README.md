The analysis explores Sachin Tendulkar's ODI cricket performance data, focusing on statistical significance tests and exploratory data analysis (EDA). It investigates scoring patterns across innings (first vs. second), matches won vs. lost, and centuries vs. non-centuries using hypothesis testing techniques like t-tests, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and Chi-square tests. Key insights include differences in runs scored in winning vs. losing matches, performance consistency across years, and correlations between various performance metrics (e.g., runs, balls faced, fours, and sixes). The study also examines empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs), quantile-quantile (QQ) plots, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests to assess the distribution of runs in different scenarios. Variance between innings is analyzed using Levene's test. Additional analysis highlights Sachin's performance against different teams, including bootstrap-based confidence intervals and win-loss associations. Finally, the analysis incorporates random data sampling and normality checks using Shapiro-Wilk and KS tests, providing a comprehensive statistical overview of Sachin Tendulkar's illustrious career.
